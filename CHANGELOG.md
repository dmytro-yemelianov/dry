## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-22

### Added
- **Core Engine & IR (`dry-core`)**:
  - Implemented core intermediate representation (Dry IR) for toolpath serialization.
  - Added physical simulation metric calculations (`time`, `distance`, `material`, `peak-flow`).
  - Added G-code emitter with Marlin, Klipper, and Duet dialect support.
  - Implemented firmware flavor-specific dwell semantics (e.g. `G4 P` for Klipper, `G4 S` for Marlin/Duet).
  - Versioned profile model supporting build volume limits, speed ranges, nozzle temperature, and flow limit validations.
  - Custom safety verification contracts (out of bounds, excessive flow, cold extrusion, orientation correctness, monotonic-Z checks).
- **L2 Optimizations**:
  - Added collinear segment merging optimization pass to clean redundant vertices.
  - Added native arc fitting (`G2`/`G3`) optimization pass to compress line sequences.
  - Added travel path reordering optimization pass to reduce travel time and length.
  - Added adaptive speed scaling pass based on junction angle and curvature.
  - Added coasting optimization pass to reduce extrusion before travel moves.
  - Added Z-hop optimization pass to lift nozzle over travel runs.
- **Language Bindings & SDKs**:
  - Created PyO3 native Python extension module and a pythonic SDK (`dry-py`).
  - Created WebAssembly adapter (`dry-wasm`) enabling compiler execution inside browsers.
  - Created TypeScript authoring SDK (`@dry/sdk`) mirroring the Python design APIs.
- **Visual Authoring & Playground**:
  - Interactive HTML5 authoring surface with Blockly-based compiler pipeline.
  - Live 3D path visualization, sync'd G-code syntax highlighting, and simulation reports.
